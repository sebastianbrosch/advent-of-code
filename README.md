# Advent of Code
This repository is used to store the solutions for Advent of Code. I am using the puzzles to learn or practice some programming languages.

## Powershell Scripts
You can create a new solution using the script `new.ps1`. An existing solution can be executed with the script `run.ps1`. To create and run the solution for Advent of Code - Day 1 you can use the scripts like this:

```
.\new 2023 1
.\run 2023 1
```

You can also use the named parameters to run the scripts:

```
.\new -year 2023 -day 1
.\run -year 2023 -day 1
```
